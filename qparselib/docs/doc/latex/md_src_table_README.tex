A table stores the result of parsing wrt a given grammar. It defines the associations to {\ttfamily keys} of {\ttfamily records}, where every {\ttfamily records} contains some {\ttfamily runs}, and can be requested for a k-\/best {\ttfamily run}.

{\ttfamily Keys} \+: Several classes of {\ttfamily keys} are implemented (named {\ttfamily Ptr$\ast$}), made of different components, amongst\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item state
\item rank (kth best number)
\item interval bounds and alignments
\item pre and post values.
\end{DoxyItemize}

A {\ttfamily key} can have unknown components, and in this case it is called partial. Partial {\ttfamily keys} can be completed symbolic constraint solving techniques (see below).

{\ttfamily Runs} \+: A {\ttfamily run} is either a tuple of {\ttfamily keys} (inner {\ttfamily run}) or a {\ttfamily label} (terminal = leaf {\ttfamily run}). A {\ttfamily key} in a {\ttfamily run} defines a pointer to a sub-\/{\ttfamily run}\+: it is the k-\/best {\ttfamily run} (according to the rank) for the {\ttfamily key} defined by other components of the pointer. Therefore, one can reconstruct a tree given a {\ttfamily run} and a {\ttfamily table}, and a {\ttfamily table} associates best trees (with {\ttfamily labels} in leaves) to {\ttfamily keys}.

An inner {\ttfamily run} is partial when some of its {\ttfamily key} is unknown or when its weight is not computed (from the weights of sub-\/{\ttfamily runs}). We complete a {\ttfamily run} by updating the {\ttfamily keys} and weight from left to right.

{\ttfamily Records} \+: A {\ttfamily record} stores (complete) {\ttfamily runs}. Bests {\ttfamily runs} can be accessed from a record.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classTable}{Table}}} \+: A {\ttfamily table} associates a {\ttfamily record} (hence best {\ttfamily runs}) to a (complete) {\ttfamily key}. One can add a {\ttfamily run} to a {\ttfamily key} in a given {\ttfamily table}. More precisely\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item one can add a complete {\ttfamily run} to a complete {\ttfamily key} \+: the {\ttfamily run} is then just added to the associated {\ttfamily record}.
\item one can add a partial {\ttfamily run} to a {\ttfamily key}. In that case the {\ttfamily run} is completed first.
\item one can add a complete {\ttfamily run} to a partial {\ttfamily key} \+: the {\ttfamily key} is then completed according to the values in the {\ttfamily run}. Some example can be found in notes.
