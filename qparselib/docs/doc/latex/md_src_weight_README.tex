Definition of several domains and operations for the weights of automata. Each of them is defined as a semiring, with


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a weight domain,
\item a binary operator {\ttfamily add} (associative, commutative),
\item a neutral element {\ttfamily zero} for {\ttfamily plus},
\item a binary operator {\ttfamily mult} (associative),
\item a neutral element {\ttfamily one} for mult,
\end{DoxyItemize}

such that {\ttfamily zero} is an absorbing element for {\ttfamily mult} and {\ttfamily mult} distributes over {\ttfamily plus}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classWeight}{Weight}}} is a structure of polymorphic weight. i.\+e. a wrapper (envelop) containing a pointer to a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classLetterWeight}{Letter\+Weight}}}. A {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classWeight}{Weight}}} with an empty pointer is called unknown.
\item a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classLetterWeight}{Letter\+Weight}}} is the definition of a semiring. We have implemented the following {\ttfamily Letter\+Weights}\+:
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classFloatWeight}{Float\+Weight}}} \+: scalar weight values
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item domain \+: floating point numbers
\item operator {\ttfamily add} is +
\item {\ttfamily zero} is 0.\+0
\item operator {\ttfamily mult} is $\ast$
\item {\ttfamily one} is 1.\+0
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classTropicalWeight}{Tropical\+Weight}}} \+: tropical algebra\+: scalar weight values are non-\/negative floating point numbers
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item domain \+: positive or null double + infinity
\item operator {\ttfamily add} is min
\item {\ttfamily zero} is infinity
\item operator {\ttfamily mult} is +
\item {\ttfamily one} is 0
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classViterbiWeight}{Viterbi\+Weight}}} \+: scalar weight values are probabilities of the best derivations
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item domain \+: positive or null rational numbers in \mbox{[}0, 1\mbox{]}
\item operator {\ttfamily add} is max
\item {\ttfamily zero} is 0
\item operator {\ttfamily mult} is $\ast$
\item {\ttfamily one} is 1
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDistance}{Distance}}} \+: a particular case of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classTropicalWeight}{Tropical\+Weight}}} which can be constructed from an interval of an input segment, and corresponds to the distance of alignement of the points on the left and right bounds of the interval.
\item {\ttfamily Performance\+Model} \+: a particular case of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classViterbiWeight}{Viterbi\+Weight}}} which can be constructed from an interval of an input segment, and defines a probability of alignment of the points on the left and right bounds of the interval, following a Gaussian distribution.
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classCountingWeight}{Counting\+Weight}}} \+: a algebra of weight for counting the number of applications of automata transitions rules on a given corpus. Useful for computation of Viterbi \mbox{\hyperlink{classWeight}{Weight}} values from corpus.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item domain \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item vectors of fixed dim k $>$ 0
\item + F\+A\+IL = stuck (0 run in state s for 1 tree)
\item + E\+R\+R\+OR = ambiguity in grammar (2 runs for 1 tree)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item operator {\ttfamily add} \+: for all x, y vectors dim k
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x + y = E\+R\+R\+OR
\item E\+R\+R\+OR is absorbing for +
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily zero} = F\+A\+IL
\item operator {\ttfamily mult} \+: for all x, y vectors dim k
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x . y = component-\/wise sum
\item x . F\+A\+IL = F\+A\+IL . x = F\+A\+IL
\item F\+A\+IL . F\+A\+IL = F\+A\+IL
\item is E\+R\+R\+OR absorbing for .
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily one} = null vector of dim k 
\end{DoxyItemize}
