Facilities for reading and writing the data given in input to the quantization by parsing algorithm, i.\+e.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the grammar ({\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classWTA}{W\+TA}}})
\item sequence of timestamped musical events ({\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classInputSegment}{Input\+Segment}}}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The grammar can be read from a text file describing transition rules and some options (weight type, maximum number of grace notes). For details on the syntax of transition rules and options, see ../../\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}top readme\char`\"{}.

A grammar can can also be saved to a file.

The input segment can be read from files in two formats\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item text format.
\item M\+I\+DI file input. based on the library \href{http://midifile.sapp.org}{\texttt{ Midifile}} of Craig Stuart Sapp.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The input segment (updated with quantized dates after quantization) can be exported (written) as a M\+I\+DI file.
