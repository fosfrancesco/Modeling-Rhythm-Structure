Classes related to rhythm {\ttfamily grammars} used in input for quantization by parsing.

A {\ttfamily grammar} (or weighted tree automaton, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classWTA}{W\+TA}}}) associates to every tree with {\ttfamily labeled} leaves a unique weight value, in one of the domain defined in directory {\ttfamily weight} (a unique {\ttfamily weight} domain is fixed for a {\ttfamily grammar}).

A {\ttfamily grammar} is defined by a list of {\ttfamily transition} rules, were each transition rule is defined by a target {\ttfamily state}, a body (sequence of states) and a {\ttfamily weight}. An initial {\ttfamily state} is distinguished in every {\ttfamily grammar}.

For reading and saving a {\ttfamily grammar} from a text file, describing transition rules and options, see ../input/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}src/input/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E\char`\"{}.
