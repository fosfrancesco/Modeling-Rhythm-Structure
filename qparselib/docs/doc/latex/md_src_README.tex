for rhythm quantization by k-\/best parsing algorithms based on weighted tree automata.

The sources are organized into the following sub-\/directories.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item targets \+: main functions for producing various command line utilities.
\item general \+: initialization, tracing.
\item weight \+: several possible domains for weight values for tree automata.
\item schemata \+: class of weighted tree automata used for parsing.
\item segment \+: classes for abstract representation of data in input processed by parsing.
\item table \+: parse tables.
\item parsers \+: various transcription scenarii, by parsing of a given {\ttfamily input}, assembling elements from the {\ttfamily table} directory.
\item input \+: reading from and writing to files the data given in input to the quantization by parsing algorithm (schema and segment).
\item score model \+: abstract model used to produce scores in various formats from parse trees.
\item output \+: representation of the output of the parsing procedure and conversion into music transcription results.
