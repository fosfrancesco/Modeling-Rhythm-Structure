/// each record is associated to a Ptr
/// it can be filled with add
/// and can be interrogating with best,
/// for retrieving the best runs for the associated Ptr.
///
/// when uncomplete runs are added to the record
/// (either by the record or from outside)
/// their weight must be computed using a table.
///
/// there are 3 similar kinds of Run* that should not be added in record:
/// TBC should not be returned by best on the record ?
/// - NULL ptr to Run
/// - ptr to Run with unknown weight (i.e. weight with NULL letter)
///   that case includes null runs.
/// - ptr to Run with weight == zero (acc. to test zero()).
/// a Run not in these 3 case is called valid.
///
/// [update] the runs with weight zero (still invalid) can be added to records
/// but an error message is displayed (for debugging).
